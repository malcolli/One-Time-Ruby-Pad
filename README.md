# One Time Pad with Ruby

The only genuinely unbreakable cipher made with ruby

## What is One Time Pad?

In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is larger than or equal to the size of the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition. It is also the only genuinely unbreakable cipher.


## Next Steps (WIP)

- Update Specs
- Create an interface (From Console to Web App)
- Add detailed description
